## Puprose
The main goal of this project is to make it possible to try on glasses in augmented reality.
The project would be realized using the React, Bootstrap and Face API.
We can separate a few base problems:
- to make adaptive layout
- improve accuracy of face recognition using gradient mask
- cover our code by tests
